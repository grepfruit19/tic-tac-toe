# Tic Tac Toe

Sample repository for teaching basics of coding.

# Day 2

We're going to learn some of the basics of JavaScript by creating a data structure that stores a tic-tac-toe board.

A data structure is how we store information. The most basic data structure (and the one we'll be using today) is called an array, or a list.

An array stores thing in a sequence. You can declare an array in JS like this:

```js
// Declare an empty array
const emptyArray = [];

// You can also declare an array with things already in it
const arrayWithStuff = ["zero", "one", "two"];

// You can fetch things from an array using brackets, like this.
const fetch = arrayWithStuff[0]; // This will assign "one" to fetch.

// You can also add things to an array with a similar notation:
arrayWithStuff[4] = "four"; // This will add four to the end.

// You can also modify existing elements in an array as such
arrayWithStuff[0] = "oops"; // This will replace the "one" above with "oops"
```

Arrays can also contain other arrays, like this

```js
const arrayInArray = [[]];

// And maybe you can see where we're going with this:
const grid = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
];

/*
    1. What's the initial state?
    2. Check row/column/diagonal win condition
    3. How to represent X vs O
    4. Who's turn is it?
    5. How to reset to initial state?
    6. How to add an X or O to the board? Where is it gonna be etc
*/
```

Arrays in arrays are also known as 2D arrays. So lets figure out how we'd represent our tic-tac-toe using a 2D array.

Once we've done that, what does the game of tic-tac-toe actually entail? What game states and conditions do we need to check for?

We're going to play around with HTML divs, and try to learn how to arrange them. Learning how to arrange divs is probably the most complicated part of basic HTML/CSS.
